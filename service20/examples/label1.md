:round_drawing_pin: Related Context
Replaces the Bristol Energy municipal energy supplier, after its collapse.
Model now being studied by other cities (e.g. Glasgow, Manchester) as a template for “city decarbonisation concessions.”
Early projects include:
Heat Network extensions (Temple, Bedminster, Old Market)
Solar PV on schools and depots
Building management system upgrades in council properties
